# React Todo List

A simple Todo List application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Material-UI**. This project demonstrates how to create a functional todo list with features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks while maintaining type safety using TypeScript. I was able to effectively utilize state and props  to manage the dynamic nature of the list.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Fully responsive UI using Material-UI components.
